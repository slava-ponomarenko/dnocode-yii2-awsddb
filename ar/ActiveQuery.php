/**
 * ActiveQuery represents a DB query associated with an Active Record class.
 *
 * An ActiveQuery can be a normal query or be used in a relational context.
 *
 * ActiveQuery instances are usually created by [[ActiveRecord::find()]] and [[ActiveRecord::findBySql()]].
 * Relational queries are created by [[ActiveRecord::hasOne()]] and [[ActiveRecord::hasMany()]].
 *
 * Normal Query
 * ------------
 *
 * ActiveQuery mainly provides the following methods to retrieve the query results:
 *
 * - [[one()]]: returns a single record populated with the first row of data.
 * - [[all()]]: returns all records based on the query results.
 * - [[count()]]: returns the number of records.
 * - [[sum()]]: returns the sum over the specified column.
 * - [[average()]]: returns the average over the specified column.
 * - [[min()]]: returns the min over the specified column.
 * - [[max()]]: returns the max over the specified column.
 * - [[scalar()]]: returns the value of the first column in the first row of the query result.
 * - [[column()]]: returns the value of the first column in the query result.
 * - [[exists()]]: returns a value indicating whether the query result has data or not.
 *
 * Because ActiveQuery extends from [[Query]], one can use query methods, such as [[where()]],
 * [[orderBy()]] to customize the query options.
 *
 * ActiveQuery also provides the following additional query options:
 *
 * - [[with()]]: list of relations that this query should be performed with.
 * - [[indexBy()]]: the name of the column by which the query result should be indexed.
 * - [[asArray()]]: whether to return each record as an array.
 *
 * These options can be configured using methods of the same name. For example:
 *
 * ```php
 * $customers = Customer::find()->with('orders')->asArray()->all();
 * ```
 *
 * Relational query
 * ----------------
 *
 * In relational context ActiveQuery represents a relation between two Active Record classes.
 *
 * Relational ActiveQuery instances are usually created by calling [[ActiveRecord::hasOne()]] and
 * [[ActiveRecord::hasMany()]]. An Active Record class declares a relation by defining
 * a getter method which calls one of the above methods and returns the created ActiveQuery object.
 *
 * A relation is specified by [[link]] which represents the association between columns
 * of different tables; and the multiplicity of the relation is indicated by [[multiple]].
 *
 * If a relation involves a junction table, it may be specified by [[via()]] or [[viaTable()]] method.
 * These methods may only be called in a relational context. Same is true for [[inverseOf()]], which
 * marks a relation as inverse of another relation and [[onCondition()]] which adds a condition that
 * is to be added to relational query join condition.
 *
